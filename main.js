Level 1 In the first level you will start by producing a list of the happy primes below 100 from a list of primes 
and a list of happy numbers. Then take a user input and determine if that number is a happy prime or not.

Prime Numbers Below 100:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

Happy Numbers Below 100:

[1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97, 100]

console.log("hello world");

var userInput = prompt("choose a number between 1 and 100", "xxx");

let arrayPrimeNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];

let arrayHappyNumbers = [1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97, 100];
